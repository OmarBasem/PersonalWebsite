            <p class="projectDesc">I have developed a data-intensive application in Python used to analyze previously
                tracked documents data on issuu.com. The application is used to analyze json files and produce meaningful
                plots for different tasks, such as analyzing, for a given document, from which countries and continents
                the document has been viewed. Also, given a particular document, the application can make recommendations
                “similar” to that document.</p>
