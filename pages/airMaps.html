    <p class="txt">Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. In this program
    the nodes would be the airport. This nodes connected together will form a graph - a directed weighted
    graph. In order for dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices a and b, it picks the unvisited
        vertex with the lowest distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the
        neighbor's distance if smaller, then mark as visited when done with neighbors. The programs relies on other algorithms
    as well that are extensions of the Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm from the JGraphT library.</p>
    <p class="txt">There are 9 different criteria for the user to choose from:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cheapest route from one airport to another.</li>
        <li>Fewest number of changeovers.</li>
        <li>Cheapest Route excluding one or more airports.</li>
        <li>Fewest number of changeovers, excluding one or more airports.</li>
        <li>List of cheapest routes below a price excluding one or more airports.</li>
        <li>List of least changeovers routes excluding one or more airports.</li>
        <li>Cheapest meet up airport given two airports.</li>
        <li>Least hop meet up airport given two airports.</li>
        <li>Least time meet up airport between two airports given a starting time.</li>
