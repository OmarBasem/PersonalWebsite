    <h1 class="header">Stick Protocol Evaluation Results</h1>
    <h2 class="subHeader">Experimental Setup</h2>
    <p class="txt evalTxt">We aim to make our experiments as realistic as possible. The Stick protocol is already being
        used
        for a social network application called STiiiCK which will be released to production soon. We
        will use STiiiCK for our experiments. To make sure our implementation will run smoothly on a
        wide range of devices, we will be testing on 2 average devices: an iOS device - iPhone 6s, and an
        Android device - Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite, with benchmarks of 531 and 533 respectively
        (to put that into perspective, that’s only 1/3 of the top-ranking phone (Geekbench, 2021)). The
        devices will be communicating with a remote server - about 4900km away - running Python 3.8
        on Amazon Linux 2 and connected to a PostgreSQL database. The application running on the
        mobile devices is in release mode. All tests were done under the same Internet conditions. Each
        experiment was repeated 20 times on each device, then the average was taken.</p>


    <h2 class="subHeader evalSubHeader">Sharing Content</h2>
    <p class="txt evalTxt">In the first experiment, we aim to verify that sharing of content using the Stick protocol
        causes
        negligible performance overhead in comparison to not using E2EE. There are 3 cases to test:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Case 0</b>: No end-to-end encryption being used</li>
        <li><b>Case 1</b>: Stick protocol E2EE - the user needs to make a request to the server to get the
            stickId, then encrypt & share the content. No extra sender keys needs to be shared.
        </li>
        <li><b>Case 2</b>: Stick protocol E2EE (less common) - the user needs to make a request to the
            server to get the stickId of a new sticky session, in addition to a list of users (2 in this case)
            to share the sender key with. The user will need to fetch PKBs, initialize new pairwise
            sessions, initialize a new sticky session, encrypt the sender keys and upload them. Then,
            the user can encrypt & share the content.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <figcaption>Stick Protocol vs No E2EE - Sharing Content</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="txt evalTxt">For each case, a user is trying to share 10 photos (≈25MB) and a 20 seconds video (≈40MB). To
        keep the measurements as realistic as possible, the tests include standard media pre-processing
        such as: compression & creating thumbnails. Figure 6.1 shows the results. Sharing 10 photos
        with no E2EE took ≈3.5s. Introducing E2EE using the Stick protocol in case 1 took an extra
        ≈0.3s. Stick protocol worst case took ≈4.3s (less than one extra second). Sharing a 20 seconds
        video with no E2EE took ≈28.6s. Stick protocol case 1 took an extra ≈0.7s. Stick protocol
        worst case took ≈29.7s. Only 1.1 extra seconds. We can see that the overhead is negligible.</p>
    <h2 class="subHeader evalSubHeader">Receiving Content</h2>
    <p class="txt evalTxt">In this experiment, we aim to verify that receiving content that is end-to-end encrypted
        using
        the Stick protocol causes negligible performance overhead in comparison to not using E2EE.
        Again, there are 3 cases to test:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Case 0</b>: No end-to-end encryption being used</li>
        <li><b>Case 1</b>: Stick protocol E2EE - the user already has the corresponding sticky session
            initialized. The user can download and decrypt the content.
        </li>
        <li><b>Case 2</b>: Stick protocol E2EE (less common) - the user does not have the corresponding
            sticky session initialized. The user will need to fetch the corresponding sender key from
            the server, decrypt it and initialize the sticky session. Then, the user can download and
            decrypt the content..
        </li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <img src="../images/eval2.png" class="evalImg"/>
        <figcaption>Stick Protocol vs No E2EE - Receiving Content</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="txt evalTxt">In each case, the user is receiving a photo (≈1MB) and a video (≈5MB). Figure 6.2 summarizes
the results. Case 0 took ≈1.4s and ≈3.1s for the photo and the video respectively. Introducing
E2EE using the Stick protocol took an extra ≈0.1s only. Stick protocol worst case took ≈1.6s and
≈3.3s for the photo and the video respectively (≈+0.2s). The overhead of receiving encrypted
content is even more negligible</p>
    <p class="txt evalTxt">The average overhead of sharing and receving content is 5.3% only.</p>
