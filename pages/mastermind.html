    <p class="txt">The following figure shows a debug mode sample. The program starts by asking the user for the colors
        count
        and the sequence size that the user has to guess. Each color is represented by a number. The user chooses 3
        colors and a sequence size of 3.
        In debug mode the secret is printed which is "2 1 2". After every guess the program tells the user the number of
        exact matches followed
        by the number of approximate matches. On a RaspberryPi the input is through the single button and the user gets
        the output as several
        LED blinks. So an input of "2 1 2" would be represented by 2 button presses, then wait for a blink, then one
        button press, then wait for blink,
        then finally 2 button presses. Getting 2 exact matches and 1 approx. would be represented by 2 (green) blinks, then a
        separator blink of another color(white), then another (green) blink.</p>
