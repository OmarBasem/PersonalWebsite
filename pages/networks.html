    <p class="txt">Since EIGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol, a router running EIGRP can
        dynamically find the best path between any two "layer 3" nodes through the process of
        sending and receiving routing advertisements to and from its neighboring EIGRP
        routers. When communicating with its neighboring EIGRP routers, a router will send
        5 different packets: Hello, Update, Query, Reply, Acknowledgement. This can be seen when capturing a newly
        connected link to an EIGRP router.</p>

    <p class="caption">Hello, Update, Query, Reply & Acknowledgement of EIGRP</p>
    <p class="txt">On a stable network, only Hello packets would be sent, which results in a very low usage of network
        resources during normal operation. This can be noticed when capturing any link connected to an EIGRP router.</p>

    <p class="caption">Hello packets from EIGRP router</p>
    <p class="txt">EIGRP should not form neighbor adjacency links on any interface where other
        EIGRP routers do not exist for security reasons. In Figure 4, if router R3 was not an
        EIGRP router then, no routing advertisements should be sent through the interface
        between router R1 and router R3. Capturing the link between R1 and R3 shows
        routing advertisements from both R1 (192.168.6.1) and R3 (192.168.6.2).</p>
    <img src="../images/adsPackets.png" alt="EIGRP Routing advertisements captured using Wireshark"/>
    <p class="caption">Routing advertisements on link R1-R3</p>
    <p class="txt">In case R3 was not EIGRP router, then the interface from R1 to R3 can set to be passive, and no
        routing advertisements would be captured on that particular link. Routing advertisements would still be captured
        from other interfaces.</p>

    <p class="caption">A similar Tree Topology, but now using OSPF Networking Protocol</p>
    <p class="txt">Since OSPF is a Link state routing protocol, it uses LSA floods as a mechanism of advertising. The figure below
        shows some captured LSA floods that includes Hello, Update and Acknowledgement packets.</p>
