        <h2 class="subHeader">ECB Mode</h2>
        <p class="txt" style="margin-top: 2vh">The figure below shows the decrypted file in binary in ECB mode. In total
            131 bits
            were changed among 32 bytes highlighted in dark red. The encryption and decryption commands above are used for the
        rest of the modes, substituting CBC with the corresponding mode.</p>

        <h2 class="subHeader">CFB Mode</h2>
        <p class="txt" style="margin-top: 2vh">The figure below shows the decrypted file in binary in CFB mode. In total
            132 bits were changed among 36 bytes highlighted in dark red.</p>
        <img src="../images/CBC.png" alt="CFB" class="encBinary"/>

        <h2 class="subHeader">OFB Mode</h2>
        <p class="txt" style="margin-top: 2vh">The figure below shows the decrypted file in binary in ECB mode. In total
            2 bits were changed among 2 bytes highlighted in dark red.</p>
        <img src="../images/CBC.png" alt="OFB" class="encBinary"/>

        <h2 class="subHeader">Analysis</h2>
        <img src="../images/ENCTable.png" alt="Encryption modes analysis" class="encTable"/>
        <p style="margin-top: 2vh">The table above summarizes the results. It is clear that OFB causes the least change
            in the decrypted files. Precisely, only the changed bits before decryption are the changed bits after
            decryption. This is expected because OFB works like a stream cipher where ciphertext bit error does not
            propagate.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2vh">The change in CFB, CBC and ECB are close, but CFB has caused the most change with 36
            bytes. Both CFB and CBC
            has caused changed across 4 blocks. This was expected since in both modes the nth cipher block depends on
            the n-1th cipher block. The amount of change caused in ECB is similar to CFB and CBC, only one bit and few
            bytes less. However, the difference is that change happened in 2 blocks only. This is due to C.n = Enc(P.n),
            where C.n is the nth cipher block, and P.n is the nth plaintext block.
            It can be noticed that every single byte of these 2 blocks was changed unlike CFB and CBC where the change
            was across 4 different blocks.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2vh">It can be noticed also that in CBC, the blocks where the bits were changed, caused
            every byte in that block
            to change, and only one byte in the following block to change.
            In CFB, almost the opposite of that behaviour, the blocks where the bits were changed caused only 1 or 2
            bytes to change in that block, and every single byte to change in the following block.
            The above difference between CBC and CFB is because where the XORing is happening:</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2vh">CBC: C.n = Enc(P.n⊕C.n-1)
            <br/>In CBC we XOR before encryption.
            <br/>CFB: C.n = Enc(C.n-1) ⊕ P.n
            <br/>In CFB we XOR after encryption</p>
